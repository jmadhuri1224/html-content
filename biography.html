<h3 id="about-kimtaehyung">about-kimtaehyung</h3>
<p>Kim Tae-hyung (Korean: 김태형; born December 30, 1995),[1] also known professionally as V (Korean: 뷔), is a South Korean singer and a member of the boy band BTS.[2] Since his debut with the group in 2013, V has released three solo tracks under their name—"Stigma" in 2016, "Singularity" in 2018, and "Inner Child" in 2020—all of which charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He appeared on the soundtrack for the television series Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth in 2016 and released his first independent song, the self-composed "Scenery", in 2019Kim Tae-Hyung, famous for the name V, is a well-known South Korean vocalist, lyrics writer, and composer, born on 30 December 1995. Kim is a member of the most popular South Korean boy band, Bangtan Boys (BTS)."Daegu child": Kim was born to a middle-class farming family in Daegu. He is close to his family, especially his grandmother, who helped and guided him in every situation. According to media sources, his song heartfelt winter bear was written for his grandma.
Kim never wants to become an idol: One of BTS's finest vocalists and performers joined the group due to an unlikely turn of events. He went to tryouts to support a friend, and as a result, he was offered the chance to train under an idol. That day, Kim and other BTS ARMY shared good fortune. After that, he worked for Big Hit Entertainment for over three years as a music coach before making his debut in 2013.
Kim nearly gave up on being a trainee: Before BTS made its debut, Kim called his father to inform him that he wanted to resign. The singer talked about such circumstances stating that "becoming a trainer was quite stressful". Kim later informed this incident in the media, saying, "I called him crying. I told him I wanted to stop, and he said, "If it's too hard, you may resign." Anyone can lose patience after the idol's long, exhausting training experience.
The perfect BFFs: Kim and Jimin are now bandmates from their school time, and they both enrolled in BTS as trainees.
The ambidextrous Kim: Kim Tae Hyung is basically left-handed, but now he has trained his mind to use his right and left hands equally. The Run BTS episodes have shown him playing with both hands.
Kim likes Cocoa with Coffee: Kim doesn't like coffee very much and prefers a sweet drink to the bitter one. Maybe it's not his cup of "coffee". He never joins coffee meetings with his bandmates. He may be seen holding coffee and chocolate beverage mugs in a video, and he swallowed the chocolate after inhaling the coffee's fragrance.
Last to be decided was V's stage name: Kim, who we now refer to as V, may have been Six or Lex. Before his debut, those were the other possibilities for nicknames. However, the BTS members reportedly told the K-pop idol that V fits him better. So, he (Kim) decided 'V', stating, "I chose V to stand for victory".
The saxophonist: V could have quickly become a saxophonist if he had not been an idol, as he once said. In middle school, he played the saxophone for three years. Additionally, he performed on the Star Show 360 for almost seven years.
The photojournalist, Vante: Kim is passionate about photography apart from music, and he is usually motivated by his photography passion by Ante Badzim, a famous Korean photographer. Most of the time, V used the hashtag Vante in his posts, as you may have seen. That is his way of honouring the artist.
The Poet Warrior, played by Kim Tae-Hyung: As most of us may be aware, Kim Tae Hyung's dream of making his acting debut came true. He played a role in Hansung University on 2016 in the Korean historical drama Hwarang. He won great viewers' responses in his very first performance.
Kim's passion for art: Kim most likely enjoys his free time in music art galleries and drawing nature paintings. In an interview, he said he prefers spending his free time mostly in art museums.
Kim's role model: In an interview, Kim mentioned that he looks up to his father as a role model. He also included that his father greatly supported him during his struggling days. Kim always listens to his father's advice when he is sad and needs support from him.

Kim or 'V' has sung more than three solo single music tracks, and these tracks have been made available under various popular brands like "Stigma" (released in 2016), "Singularity" (released in 2018), and "Inner Child" (released in 2020). These three songs of Kim achieved massive success on the Gaon Digital Chart in South Korea. Later in 2019, Kim released his new album, "Scenery", a piece of self-penned digital music, which served as his debut independent single. Along with his bandmate Jin, V also made his presence on the audience in the Hwarang, The Poet Warrior Youth (2016) soundtrack. Kim is so popular among today's youth, especially among girls, all over the world</p>
